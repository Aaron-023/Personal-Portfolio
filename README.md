# Personal Portfolio - A Codecademy Project

## This project is to build my own personal portfolio, it must follow the below criteria:

- Build a website using HTML, CSS
- Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Develop locally on your computer

### Notes

As website styling is my lesser favourite task, I've decided to opt for a clean dark style, which naturally led to questioning how I would draw a user to specific project sections and links. 

I've opted for the use of colour, icons, and transitions as a user hovers over various elements of the site.
